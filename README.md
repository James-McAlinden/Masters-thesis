# Masters thesis
Whilst I was a postgraduate psychology student at the University of Aberdeen, I completed my thesis. The aim of my thesis was to investigate emotional resilience, social competence, and family coherence as predictors of word reading proficiency among university students. Understanding the specific link between emotional resilience and word reading proficiency will help determine whether emotional resilience interventions should be included in university reading programs.

Furthermore, the indirect effects that underpin the relationship between emotional resilience and word reading proficiency are poorly understood. If my findings suggested that emotional resilience interventions could be beneficial for students with reading disorders, then investigating these indirect relationships is important for developing, employing, and assessing these interventions.

I have included my R script when I was analysing my data and a poster I presented whilst completing my thesis.
